## 👋 Welcome to the Claude Code Masterclass!

This is a **learning sandbox** where you build a real app with AI assistance. You don't need to know how to code — you just need to know what you want to build!

---

## 🎯 The Big Idea

**You are the Engineering Lead.** You don't write code — you manage a team of AI specialists who write it for you.

```
YOU (the boss)
    ↓
"I want to build [your idea]"
    ↓
🤖 Claude analyzes, plans, and builds
    ↓
✅ Working feature!
```

---

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Complete Beginner?
Just say:
> "Where should I start?"

Or type:
```
/start-module-1
```

### Already Know What You Want?
Just tell me:
> "I want to build a [your app idea]"

I'll guide you from there!

## 👥 Experience Levels

We support THREE experience levels:

### 🌱 Complete Beginner
**"I've never coded before"**

Just say:
> "I want to build my app. Guide me through everything."

Then sit back and approve each step. You just keep saying "yes"!

**Start here:** `/start-module-0`

### 🌿 Vibe Coder
**"I've used Lovable/Bolt/v0 but hit walls"**

Say:
> "Show me what you're going to do before doing it."

You'll see the plan before execution and understand what's happening.

**Level up:** `/vibe-coder-upgrade` — Learn your new superpowers!

### 🌳 Experienced Developer
**"I've used Cursor/VS Code, comfortable with Git"**

Say:
> "Run parallel agents with git worktrees for features 2, 3, and 4"

Maximum speed, multiple features building simultaneously!

**Unlock full power:** `/expert-mode` — Parallel workflows, competitor cloning, advanced skills

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### What Are Agents?
Agents are specialized AI assistants:
- **Product Owner** — Plans features, writes tickets
- **Frontend Lead** — Builds UI components
- **Backend Lead** — Handles data & APIs

You talk to me (the main Claude session), and I coordinate with specialists when needed.

### What Are Skills?
Skills are **saved recipes** — commands that give me specific instructions.

Instead of explaining what you want every time:
```
❌ "Create a form with email validation, password requirements,
    error messages, loading state, and submit to server..."
```

You just type:
```
✅ /form-builder login form
```

**Available Skills You Can Invoke:**
| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| `scrape-technique` | Web scraping & visual analysis |
| `agency-design-system` | Premium design patterns |
| `backend-patterns` | Database & API architecture |
| `component-patterns` | React component best practices |
| `gsap-animation-patterns` | Animation techniques |

Just say: *"Using the agency-design-system skill, review my hero section"*

### What Are Hooks?
Hooks are **automatic reactions** — things that happen without you asking.

Example: After I edit a file, a hook might automatically:
- Check for errors
- Format the code
- Explain what changed

## 📁 Project Structure

Your app is organized like this:

```
your-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── page.tsx      ← Your main page
│   │   ├── layout.tsx    ← Root layout
│   │   └── globals.css   ← Global styles
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ui/           ← Reusable components

├── PLAN.md               ← Your app plan (created in Module 2)
├── CLAUDE.md             ← Instructions for me
└── package.json          ← Dependencies
```

## 🔄 The Workflow

Here's how you build with Claude Code:

```
1. DISCOVER  → Research with /product-discovery
2. PLAN      → Create Epic with /epic-create
3. FEATURES  → Break down with /plan-features
4. ENRICH    → Add specs with /enrich-features
5. BUILD     → Implement with /work-on #X
6. REVIEW    → Check quality with /code-review
7. POLISH    → Make it beautiful with /redesign
8. SHIP      → Deploy with /ship + Vercel
```

### The Agent Chain

```
🔬 Product Discovery
       ↓
👔 Product Owner → Creates Epic & Features
       ↓
🎨 Frontend Lead + ⚙️ Backend Lead → Enrich features
       ↓
🤖 Build Agent → Implements code
       ↓
🔍 Code Review → Quality check
       ↓
✨ Ship!
```

## 🆘 Common Questions

### "I don't know what to build"
That's okay! Ask me:
> "What kind of apps can I build? Give me ideas based on [my interests]."

### "I'm stuck and don't know what to do next"
Just ask:
> "What should I do next?"

I'll look at your project and suggest the next step.

### "Something is broken"
Type:
```
/fix-errors
```
Or just describe the error and I'll help fix it.

### "My app looks generic/AI-generated"
Type:
```
/redesign [what you want to improve]
```
I'll help make it look premium.

### "How do I see my app?"
```
/start-app
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### "How do I stop the server?"
```
/stop-app
```
Or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

Your app uses:
- **Next.js 15** — React framework (App Router)
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Vercel** — Deployment platform

Optional additions:
- **Supabase** or **Convex** — Database
- **Clerk** or **Auth.js** — Authentication
- **Stripe** or **LemonSqueezy** — Payments

---

## 📞 Getting Human Help

If you're at the live workshop:
- 🙋 Raise your hand — facilitators are here to help!
- 💬 Ask your neighbor — they might have solved the same issue

If you're working alone:
- 📖 Type `/workshop-help` for troubleshooting
- 🐛 Describe your error to me in detail

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific** — "Add a blue button" is better than "make it look nice"
2. **One thing at a time** — Don't ask for 10 features at once
3. **Check your work** — Use `/test-app` regularly
4. **Save progress** — Commit to GitHub often
5. **Ask "why"** — Understanding helps you learn

---

## 🎉 You've Got This!

Remember:
- **There are no stupid questions** — ask anything!
- **Errors are normal** — even experts see them constantly
- **You're the boss** — I work for you, not the other way around
- **Have fun!** — You're building something real
