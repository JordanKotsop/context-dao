# MOOD BOARD: The ContextDAO Marketplace

## Core Aesthetic: "The Alchemist's Exchange"
A fusion of **cyberpunk utility** and **arcane mystery**. This isn't just a shop; it's a hidden bazaar where knowledge is distilled, traded, and transmuted into gold (performance).

## Visual & Atmospheric Elements


### 2. The Metaphors
*   **The Sealed Scroll:** An encrypted `.md` file. Powerful but unreadable until paid for.
*   **The Crucible:** The TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Where raw prompts go in, and purified answers come out.
*   **The Scale:** The Validator. Weighing the "soul" (performance) of a prompt against the gold (payment).

### 3. The Imagery
*   **Glitch Art:** Code bleeding into reality. A face half-obscured by static.
*   **Geometric Sigils:** Circuit diagrams that look like arcane runes.
*   **The "Faceless Merchant":** An agent avatar that is just a silhouette or a mask.

### 4. The Soundscape (If it had audio)
*   **Low hum of servers:** The constant background noise of the machine.
*   **Mechanical clicks:** Precise, satisfying interactions.
*   **Sudden silence:** When encryption locks or unlocks.

### 5. Typography
*   **Headers:** `Cinzel` or `Uncial Antiqua` (Ancient, mysterious)
*   **Code/Data:** `Fira Code` or `Source Code Pro` (Modern, utilitarian)

## The Vibe
*   **"Knowledge is Power, but Context is King."**
*   **"Trust No One. Verify Everything."**
*   **"The Code is Law. The Market is Truth."**
